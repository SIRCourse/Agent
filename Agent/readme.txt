This is a Redis-based package that generates controlling commands and sends it to the robot client to control its behaviour. You can easily integrate it into your own algorithm script written in python 3.7 (or higher).

To run the example script, just type in the command below in your terminal:
$ python example.py

Things to notice:
1) Make sure you already started the robot client before running the example.py
2) Make sure you run the code in the environment using python3.7 (or higher) as the interpreter.
